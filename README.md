# PHYS211
All code, tex, and data files, etc. for the Experimental Physics sequence. Highly unlikely to be of interest to anyone not involved with the course.

Most of the Python used for this course has been written in (and intended for use with) the Pyzo Python IDE. Scripts are built for cell-wise execution, and they will therefore most likely fail in a Python environment that does not support cell-wise execution. Pyzo delimits code cells by a line beginning with `##`, so each of these blocks can be transcribed to a Jupyter/iPython Notebook cell.
